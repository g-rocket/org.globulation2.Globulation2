    <p>
      Globulation 2 brings a new type of gameplay to RTS games. The player chooses
      the number of units to assign to various tasks, and the units do their best to
      satisfy the requests. This allows players to manage more units and focus on
      strategy rather than individual unit's jobs. Globulation 2 also features AI
      allowing single-player games or any possible combination of human-computer
      teams. Also included is a scripting language for versatile gameplay or
      tutorials and an integrated map editor. Globulation2 can be played in single
      player mode, through your local network, or over the Internet with Ysagoon
      Online Gaming (or YOG for short).
